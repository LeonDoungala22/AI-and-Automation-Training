# Decision Tree Classification Project

## Overview
- **Objective:** Develop a decision tree classifier for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
- **Dataset:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Data Exploration and Visualization
1. **Balance Check:** Are there about the same number of real and fake transactions?
2. **Feature Distributions:** How do transaction amounts differ between real and fake transactions?
3. **Correlation Analysis:** What pictures or graphs show how features relate to spotting fraud?

## Data Preprocessing
4. **Outlier Handling:** How did you deal with numbers that seemed out of place in transaction amounts?
5. **Feature Scaling:** Why did you make all the features similar in size, and did it help the decision tree?
6. **Handling Missing Values:** How did you fill in the blanks in the data, and did it affect finding fraud?
7. **Data Encoding:** Why did you change some words into numbers, and what difference did it make?

## Model Building and Evaluation
8. **Splitting Criteria Experimentation:** What ways did you try to split the data for the decision tree, and which worked best?
9. **Ensemble Methods:** Did using a group of decision trees together (Random Forest) work better than using just one?
10. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** What settings did you change to get the best results in the decision tree?
11. **Model Interpretability:** Why did you want the decision tree to be easy to understand, and how did you keep it that way?

## Deep Understanding and Visualization
12. **Key Decision Nodes Analysis:** Which choices in the decision tree mattered the most for finding fraud?
13. **Decision Boundary Visualization:** How did you show where the decision tree thinks real transactions end and fake ones begin?
14. **Partial Dependence Plots:** What pictures helped you understand how each feature connects to finding fraud?

## Model Evaluation and Conclusion
15. **Model Performance:** How well did the decision tree find fraud, and what numbers show that?
16. **Interpretability vs. Accuracy Balance:** Why is it important that people can understand how the decision tree works?
17. **Feature Importance Insights:** Which parts of the data were the most important for finding fraud?

## Conclusion and Future Work
18. **Recommendations for Improvement:** What ideas do you have for making the decision tree better?
19. **Business Impact:** How might using this decision tree help companies in the real world?
20. **Ethical Considerations:** Did you think about how the decision tree might affect people, and what did you do to make sure it's fair?
21. **Future Work:** What would you like to explore or do next with the decision tree?
