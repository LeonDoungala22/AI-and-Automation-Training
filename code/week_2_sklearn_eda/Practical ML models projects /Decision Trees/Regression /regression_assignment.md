# Decision Tree Regression Project

## Dataset
- [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

## Assignment Questions

### Data Exploration and Visualization
1. Visualize the distribution of the target variable ("SalePrice"). What insights can you gather from this visualization?
2. Create scatter plots or other suitable visualizations to explore the relationships between key numerical features and the target variable.

### Correlation Analysis
3. Use visualizations (e.g., heatmap) to explore the correlation between different features and the target variable.
4. How does the correlation analysis inform feature selection or engineering for decision tree regression?

### Model Building and Evaluation
5. Create a decision tree regressor using scikit-learn. Train the model on the training set.
6. Evaluate the regression model using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
7. Visualize the decision tree structure. How can visualizing the decision tree help interpret the model's predictions?
8. Visualize the importance of different features in the decision tree regression model.

### Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)
9. Experiment with different hyperparameter values to optimize the decision tree regressor.
10. How does changing the minimum number of samples required to split a node affect the model's performance?

### Deep Understanding Questions
11. Visualize and analyze the decision tree structure. What are the key decision nodes, and how do they contribute to the final regression predictions?
12. Explore the impact of tree depth on model performance. Discuss the concept of overfitting and the importance of pruning to address it.
