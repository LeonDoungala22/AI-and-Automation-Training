# Linear Regression Exercise

## Objective
The goal of this exercise is to apply linear regression to analyze a dataset and make predictions.

## Dataset
Download the dataset named [sales_data.csv](provide_link_here) for this exercise. The dataset consists of two columns:
1. **"Advertising Spend":** Amount spent on advertising in dollars.
2. **"Sales":** Sales revenue generated in dollars.

## Tasks
1. **Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.**
2. **Explore the dataset:** Understand its structure and characteristics.
3. **Visualize the relationship:** Use a scatter plot to explore the connection between "Advertising Spend" and "Sales."
4. **Split the dataset:** Divide it into training and testing sets.
5. **Implement linear regression:** Use an appropriate library (e.g., scikit-learn).
6. **Train the model:** On the training set.
7. **Evaluate the model's performance:** Use the testing set.
8. **Visualize the regression line:** Along with the scatter plot.
9. **Make predictions:** On new data points (create a few hypothetical data points for this purpose).

## Submission Guidelines
1. **Submit the Python code:** In a well-commented Jupyter notebook.
2. **Include visualizations:** To support your analysis.
3. **Provide explanations:** For each step of the linear regression process.
4. **Discuss model performance:** And share any insights gained from the analysis.
5. **Include a section for predictions:** On new data points, explaining how these predictions were made.

**Note:** Avoid using pre-built functions for tasks such as data loading, splitting, and evaluation. Implement these steps manually to deepen your understanding of the linear regression process.
