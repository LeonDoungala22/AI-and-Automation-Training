# Linear Regression Exercise

## Objective
The primary objective of this exercise is to apply linear regression to analyze a dataset and make predictions. This exercise will help you gain hands-on experience with linear regression and its applications in data analysis.

## Dataset
Download the dataset named [sales_data.csv](provide_link_here) for this exercise. The dataset comprises two columns:
1. **"Advertising Spend":** Amount spent on advertising in dollars.
2. **"Sales":** Sales revenue generated in dollars.

## Tasks

### 1. Load and Explore the Dataset
   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure, summary statistics, and any potential patterns.

### 2. Visualize the Relationship
   - Use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between "Advertising Spend" and "Sales."
   - Analyze the plot for any observable trends or patterns.

### 3. Data Preparation
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

### 4. Linear Regression Implementation
   - Implement linear regression using a suitable library (e.g., scikit-learn).
   - Train the linear regression model on the training set.

### 5. Model Evaluation
   - Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing set.
   - Use appropriate metrics to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

### 6. Visualization
   - Visualize the regression line along with the scatter plot to illustrate the model's predictions.

### 7. Predictions on New Data Points
   - Generate predictions for new, hypothetical data points.
   - Discuss the methodology used for making predictions.

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Code Submission**
   - Submit the Python code in a well-commented Jupyter notebook (e.g., `linear_regression_analysis.ipynb`).

2. **Visualizations**
   - Include visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, regression line plots) to support your analysis.

3. **Explanations**
   - Provide detailed explanations for each step of the linear regression process in the notebook.

4. **Performance Analysis**
   - Discuss the model's performance based on evaluation metrics and insights gained from the analysis.

5. **Predictions Section**
   - Include a section in the notebook for making predictions on new data points, explaining the prediction methodology.

**Note:** Avoid using pre-built functions for tasks such as data loading, splitting, and evaluation. Implement these steps manually to deepen your understanding of the linear regression process.
